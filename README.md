# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) of different cities based on pollutant data. By analyzing key air pollutants, the model helps in understanding air pollution trends and aids in taking necessary preventive measures for better air quality management.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts AQI based on pollutant concentrations.
- Identifies key pollutants affecting air quality.
- Helps in proactive environmental planning.

## ðŸ“‚ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AQI-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AQI-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the `AQI.ipynb` file.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
- The dataset includes pollutant concentrations such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.
- Data is collected from various monitoring stations.

## ðŸ›  Model & Methodology
- Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and normalization.
- Machine learning models trained to predict AQI values.
- Performance evaluation metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score used for validation.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
- The model accurately predicts AQI values with a reasonable error margin.
- Certain pollutants have a higher impact on AQI than others.
- Potential use in real-time AQI monitoring and forecasting systems.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
- Incorporating deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset to include more geographical locations.
- Integrating a web-based dashboard for real-time AQI monitoring.
